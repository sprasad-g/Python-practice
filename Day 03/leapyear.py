# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. 
# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
# **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
# **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print(f"{year} is  a leap year")
        else:     
            print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
    else:
         print(f"{year} is a leap year")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
